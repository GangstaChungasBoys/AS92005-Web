        <h2>The Republican Party</h2>

    <!-- Content Section 1 -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Introduction to the Republican Party</h2>
      <p>
        The Republican Party, also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party), was
        founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Today, it is one of the two
        major political parties in the United States. Republicans generally
        advocate for limited government, individual freedoms, free-market
        capitalism, and a strong national defense. Their platform is rooted in
        conservative values, emphasizing personal responsibility, traditional
        social norms, and the protection of constitutional rights.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Content Section 2 -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Key Policies and Ideals</h2>
      <p>
        The Republican Party champions lower taxes, reduced government spending,
        and deregulation to stimulate economic growth. Republicans believe in
        limited government intervention in the economy, arguing that a free
        market allows for innovation, job creation, and personal economic
        freedom. They also advocate for reducing the national debt and
        controlling government deficits by cutting government programs and
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        On social issues, Republicans tend to uphold traditional values. Many
        within the party oppose abortion rights, support the Second Amendment's
        right to bear arms, and favor stronger immigration laws to protect
        national borders and ensure national security. Republicans often promote
        a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, advocating for the
        preservation of states' rights.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Content Section 3 -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>National Defense and Foreign Policy</h2>
      <p>
        National defense is a cornerstone of Republican policy. The party
        supports maintaining a strong military presence around the world,
        arguing that peace can only be preserved through strength. Republicans
        advocate for increased defense spending to ensure that the United States
        remains capable of protecting its interests both at home and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        On foreign policy, Republicans generally promote American leadership and
        intervention in global affairs when necessary to protect national
        security or to support democracy abroad. Historically, Republicans have
        pushed for policies that maintain the U.S. as a global superpower, while
        also encouraging strong alliances with key international partners.

      <h2>Current Leader of the Republican Party</h2>

      <p>
        As of 2024, Donald Trump is recognized as the leader of the
        Republican Party. Having served as the 45th President of the United
        States from 2017 to 2021, Trump continues to have a significant
        influence over the direction of the party. His leadership is
        characterized by a strong stance on immigration reform, America-first
        policies, deregulation, and economic nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Donald Trump's popularity within the Republican base remains high, and
        his endorsement is often seen as crucial for Republican candidates
        running for office. His influence extends beyond policy and into the
        broader conservative movement, where his positions on trade,
        immigration, and foreign policy continue to shape the GOP's platform.
        Many within the party support his calls for reducing government
        interference in the economy, preserving American jobs, and securing the
        nationâ€™s borders.
