    <!-- Content Section 1 -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Introduction to the Democratic Party</h2>
      <p>
        The Democratic Party is one of the two major political parties in the
        United States and has its roots in the early 19th century. It is
        considered the more liberal or progressive party, advocating for
        policies that aim to create social equality and ensure the welfare of
        all citizens. The Democratic Party believes in the power of government
        to solve social problems, and it has historically supported labor
        unions, social safety nets, and civil rights movements.
      </p>

    <!-- Content Section 2 -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Key Policies and Ideals</h2>
      <p>
        Modern Democrats emphasize a range of issues, including healthcare
        reform, climate change, and income inequality. One of their most
        significant legislative achievements was the passage of the Affordable
        Care Act (ACA), which expanded healthcare coverage to millions of
        Americans. Additionally, the party supports environmental regulations
        and initiatives to combat climate change and transition to renewable
        energy sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Economic justice is another cornerstone of Democratic policy. The party
        supports raising the minimum wage, expanding workers' rights, and
        providing access to affordable housing. Democrats also advocate for tax
        reforms that place a greater burden on wealthier individuals and
        corporations to address wealth disparities.
      </p>

    <!-- Content Section 3 -->
    <div class="content">
      <h2>Social Issues and Civil Rights</h2>
      <p>
        The Democratic Party has long been associated with movements for social
        justice and civil rights. They champion issues like LGBTQ+ rights,
        racial equality, and women's reproductive rights. The party played a key
        role in passing landmark civil rights legislation during the 1960s,
        including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of
        1965.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, the Democrats have continued to focus on social equity,
        particularly in the areas of criminal justice reform and immigration
        policy. They support comprehensive immigration reform that includes a
        path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, as well as policies
        that protect refugees and asylum seekers.

    <p2 class="p2">
        As of 2024, Kamala Harris serves as the leader of the Democratic Party.
        A trailblazer in American politics, Harris became the first female Vice
        President of the United States in 2021, as well as the first woman of
        African American and South Asian descent to hold the office. Her
        leadership focuses on key Democratic priorities such as expanding voting
        rights, criminal justice reform, and addressing racial and economic
        inequality.
      </p2>
    <p2 class="p2">
        Throughout her political career, Harris has been an advocate for
        healthcare reform, climate action, and protecting the rights of
        marginalized communities. Her leadership within the party has also
        focused on addressing the challenges posed by systemic racism, reforming
        law enforcement, and ensuring that all Americans have access to
        affordable healthcare and education.
      </p2>
    <p2 class="p2">
        Kamala Harris has positioned herself as a strong voice for progressive
        policies and continues to push for the values and ideals that align with
        the Democratic Party's vision for a fairer and more equitable society.
