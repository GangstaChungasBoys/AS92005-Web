      <h2>The Foundation of American Politics</h2>
      <p>
        The political system in the United States is built upon the principles outlined in the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified in 1787. The Constitution provides the framework for the federal government and guarantees basic rights to its citizens. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The core elements of American democracy are rooted in the separation of powers, a system designed to prevent any one branch of government from gaining too much power. The government is divided into three branches: the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, each with distinct powers and responsibilities. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The bicameral structure of Congress — the Senate and the House of Representatives — ensures that states are represented both by population and equally, giving balance to both populous and smaller states.

      <h2>The Role of the Executive Branch</h2>
      <p>
        The President of the United States leads the executive branch, which is responsible for enforcing and administering federal laws. The President is both the head of state and the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces. Through executive orders, the President can implement policies directly, although significant legislative changes still require approval from Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The executive branch also includes the Vice President, Cabinet members, and heads of various federal agencies and departments. These individuals are tasked with managing the day-to-day operations of the government. The President’s decisions have a far-reaching impact on both domestic and foreign policy, shaping the direction of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, the power of the executive branch has evolved, with Presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln expanding the role of the Presidency during times of crisis.

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Core American Values in Politics</h2>
      <p>
        American politics is deeply influenced by core values such as liberty, equality, and democracy. These ideals are not just political slogans but principles that guide the formation of policies and laws. The belief in individual freedom is fundamental, reflected in the Bill of Rights, which ensures the protection of personal freedoms such as free speech, religion, and assembly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equality, particularly racial and economic, has been a subject of ongoing debate in American politics. The civil rights movement and the push for gender equality are key examples of how Americans strive to make their democracy more inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, democracy itself is a cornerstone of the U.S. political system. While the U.S. is a representative democracy, meaning that citizens elect officials to make decisions on their behalf, the importance of voting and civic engagement remains a critical part of American political culture.
